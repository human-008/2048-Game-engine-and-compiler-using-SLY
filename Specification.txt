1) 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 --SUBTRACT LEFT--> 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 

2) Name of the variable dropped in case value of tile becomes 0.

3) Name cannot be assigned to an empty tile/0 valued tile.

4) Tile names will be appended.

5) Each tile has a distinct name i.e. Two tiles cannot have the same name.

6) Game is only won when one of the tile values is exactly 2048.

7) Game exits automatically after the user has won it.
